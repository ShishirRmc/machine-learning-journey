# Market Basket Analysis with Apriori Algorithm

This project is part of the **Machine Learning Journey** and focuses on uncovering relationships between items in transactional data using the **Apriori Algorithm**. The analysis helps identify association rules that can be leveraged to optimize product placements, create combo deals, or enhance recommendation systems.

## Project Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Converts raw transaction data into a structured format.
- **Apriori Algorithm**: Extracts frequent itemsets and generates association rules.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows adjustment of support, confidence, and lift thresholds.
- **Insights Generation**: Provides actionable insights for decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv`, consisting of 7,501 transactions. Each row represents a transaction, and each column lists items purchased in that transaction.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed and set up the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `apyori`

## Applications
- **Retail**: Optimize product placement in stores.
- **E-commerce**: Build better product recommendation systems.
- **Marketing**: Design targeted promotions for frequent item combinations.

# Breast Cancer Prediction using Wisconsin Dataset

This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to build a machine learning model for predicting breast cancer.

## Dataset Information

- **Name**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original)
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/15/breast+cancer+wisconsin+original)
- **Attributes**:
  - **10 Features**: Clump Thickness, Uniformity of Cell Size, Uniformity of Cell Shape, etc.
  - **1 Class Attribute**: Benign (2) or Malignant (4).
  - Total instances: 699 (with missing values).

## Project Overview

### Objectives
1. Clean and preprocess the dataset.
2. Explore the features and their relationships.
3. Train and evaluate machine learning models to classify tumors as benign or malignant.
